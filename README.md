# Simple_Real_Time_Polling
Using NodeJS and Express, based on Pusher

## Basic idea
    > Real time polling app using Pusher and CanvasJS.
    > Store voting results on MongoDB, using mLab.

## Future
    > In the future, we may add an Login property to this polling app, making it more robust.
    

## Exisiting problem
    > For some reason, CanvasJS cannot show chart in real time when vote counts increasing.
